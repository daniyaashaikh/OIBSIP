# Patch Management Report

## 1. Introduction
Patch management is a vital process in IT management and cybersecurity that ensures all software systems are up-to-date with the latest patches. Patches are small updates released by software vendors to fix security vulnerabilities, correct bugs, and improve performance. Failure to apply patches can expose systems to cyber attacks, software malfunctions, and compliance issues.

## 2. Objectives of Patch Management
- **Enhance Security:** Protect systems from known vulnerabilities.  
- **Improve Performance:** Resolve bugs that may cause slowdowns or crashes.  
- **Maintain Compliance:** Ensure systems meet organizational and regulatory standards.  
- **Reduce Downtime:** Prevent software failures by proactive maintenance.

## 3. Patch Management Process
The patch management lifecycle consists of the following steps:

### 3.1 Inventory
Identify all hardware and software assets in the organization that require updates. Maintain an updated asset database.

### 3.2 Assessment
Evaluate which patches are necessary and prioritize based on risk and criticality. Security patches typically take highest priority.

### 3.3 Testing
Before deployment, patches should be tested in a controlled environment to ensure they do not conflict with existing systems or applications.

### 3.4 Deployment
Deploy patches across all relevant systems using automated tools or manual installation. Scheduling deployments during off-peak hours can minimize disruption.

### 3.5 Verification
Confirm that patches have been successfully applied and systems are functioning correctly post-deployment.

### 3.6 Documentation
Maintain detailed records of patch deployment, testing, and any issues encountered for auditing and compliance purposes.

## 4. Types of Patches
- **Security patches:** Fix vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.  
- **Bug fixes:** Resolve known errors or malfunctions.  
- **Feature updates:** Introduce new functionality or enhancements.

## 5. Tools for Patch Management
- **WSUS (Windows Server Update Services)** – For managing Windows updates.  
- **SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)** – Enterprise-level deployment.  
- **ManageEngine Patch Manager** – Cross-platform patch management.  
- **Ivanti Patch Management** – Automation of patching processes for multiple OS platforms.

## 6. Conclusion
Patch management is a continuous process essential for maintaining secure, stable, and efficient IT environments. Organizations that implement a structured patch management program can significantly reduce security risks and improve operational reliability.
