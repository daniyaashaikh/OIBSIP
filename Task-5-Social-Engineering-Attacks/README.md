# Task 5: Social Engineering Attacks

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand social engineering attacks, their
techniques, impact, and prevention strategies. This task emphasizes how
attackers exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

---

## Description
Social engineering attacks manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive
information such as passwords, financial details, or confidential
organizational data. These attacks rely on deception, trust, fear, urgency,
and human error instead of exploiting software weaknesses.

This task provides a comprehensive overview of social engineering concepts,
common attack methods, real-world examples, and best practices to prevent
such attacks.

## Conclusion
Social engineering attacks remain one of the most effective cyber threats
because they target human behavior rather than systems. Awareness, education,
and strict security practices are essential to reduce the risk of such
attacks and protect sensitive information.
