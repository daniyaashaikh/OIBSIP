# Network Security Threats Report

## Introduction
Network security threats pose significant risks to modern computer networks. These threats aim to exploit vulnerabilities in systems to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal sensitive data. Understanding these threats is essential for maintaining secure network environments.

## Types of Network Security Threats

### Denial of Service (DoS)
A Denial of Service attack overwhelms a system with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. These attacks target network bandwidth, servers, or applications.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
DDoS attacks use multiple compromised machines (botnets) to launch large-scale attacks against a target system, making detection and mitigation challenging.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
MITM attacks occur when attackers secretly intercept communication between two parties. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or unauthorized modifications.

### Spoofing Attacks
Spoofing attacks involve pretending to be a trusted entity. Common forms include IP spoofing, email spoofing, and website spoofing.

### Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffing allows attackers to capture unencrypted network traffic. Sensitive information such as login credentials can be exposed.

### DNS Poisoning
DNS poisoning manipulates DNS records to redirect users to malicious websites, leading to phishing or malware infections.
