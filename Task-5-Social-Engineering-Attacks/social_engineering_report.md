# Social Engineering Attacks Report

## Introduction
Social engineering is a type of cyber attack that relies on manipulating
people into revealing confidential information. Instead of exploiting
technical vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human psychology such as trust,
fear, curiosity, and urgency.

These attacks are highly effective because humans are often the weakest link
in security systems. Social engineering attacks can occur through emails,
phone calls, messages, or face-to-face interactions.

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### Phishing
Phishing is the most common social engineering attack. Attackers send fake
emails or messages that appear to be from trusted organizations to steal
login credentials or sensitive data.

### Spear Phishing
Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific individual
or organization. These messages are personalized to increase the chances of
success.

### Vishing
Vishing involves voice calls where attackers pretend to be bank officials,
technical support staff, or authorities to obtain sensitive information.

### Smishing
Smishing uses SMS or text messages containing malicious links or fake alerts
to trick users into sharing personal information.

### Pretexting
In pretexting, attackers create a fake scenario or identity to gain trust and
extract confidential data from victims.

### Baiting
Baiting involves offering something attractive such as free downloads or USB
drives that contain malware.
