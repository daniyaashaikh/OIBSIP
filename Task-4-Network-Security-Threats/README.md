# Task 4: Common Network Security Threats

## Objective
The objective of this task is to study and understand common network security threats that affect individuals and organizations. This task focuses on identifying different types of threats, their impacts, real-world examples, and preventive measures to enhance network security awareness.

---

## Description
Network security threats are malicious activities designed to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of network resources. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in networks to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal sensitive information.

In this task, various network security threats such as Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, spoofing, packet sniffing, and DNS poisoning are analyzed in detail.

The task helps in understanding how attackers exploit network vulnerabilities and how organizations can defend against these threats using best security practices.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
A DoS attack aims to make a system or network unavailable by overwhelming it with excessive traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing services.

### 2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
A DDoS attack is similar to DoS but is carried out using multiple compromised systems to flood the target, making mitigation more difficult.

### 3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
In a MITM attack, an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or manipulate transmitted data.

### 4. Spoofing
Spoofing involves impersonating a trusted source such as an IP address, email, or website to gain unauthorized access.

### 5. Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffing is the practice of capturing and analyzing network traffic to extract sensitive information such as passwords and credentials.

### 6. DNS Poisoning
DNS poisoning redirects users to malicious websites by corrupting DNS records.

## Preventive Measures
- Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Encrypt sensitive network communications
- Keep systems and software up to date
- Use secure authentication mechanisms
- Monitor network traffic regularly

## Outcome
By completing this task, an understanding of common network security threats and their prevention is achieved. This knowledge helps in identifying risks and applying appropriate security controls to protect network systems.
